quizbot

--------------------------------
Small and simple quizbot for IRC
--------------------------------


Use
===

Hack config.py to your liking (it's pretty self-explanatory). Write questions 
in questions.py, as per the format. Note: you need at least eleven question 
for quizbot to work properly.

Start the bot with:
	$ ./q
or:
	$ python q


Dependencies
============

quizbot is written in Python and runs on the 2.7 interpreter. The dependencies 
below are listed with the oldest versions that are confirmed to work. Older 
versions *might* work. If they do, please report it to <alexander@plaimi.net>, 
so that he can update this file.

-python 2.7.x
-twisted >= 11.0.0
-twisted-words >= 11.0.0

A Note on Python 3
------------------

The 3.x interpreter will try to run this and fail. You *need* to use a 2.x 
interpreter (2.7.x is the only one with which quizbot is formally tested). 
This may be accomplished by specifically invoking a 2.x interpreter on some 
systems.
        $ python2 q


quizbot in #quiznode on Freenode
================================

My quizbot instance runs in the #quiznode channel on irc.freenode.net:6667.  
Feel free to check it out and come play. :-)

Send questions and answers to me via email (see Author), so that quizbot has 
more to choose from. I think it's more fun to let you guys decide what you are 
interested in quizzing about, rather than parsing someone else's trivia 
questions. Us the format of questions.py, or send me a diff. At the very 
least, make sure you have "category - question - answer" or something like 
that.

Happy quizzing!


Contributing To the Project
===========================
Yes, please. Follow PEP-8: <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>.

- Improve the way question-answer pairs are stored. (Please provide code to
  convert the current structure for me to test it.)
- Write better algorithms for detecting answers.
- Make quizbot reconnect correctly when it loses its IRC connection.
- Improve ugly parts of the code (there's plenty to choose from).
- Improve commenting by to be more clear and/or informative.
- Write a hunger system for the bot. I am dead serious.

Try to keep the source very short. Please take some time to come up with the
shortest readable and logical solution to what you are trying to do. When you
are finished, send me a pull-request using Github or an email (see Author).

Please write sane commit messages. An introduction to git commit messages: 
<http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>. Do 
small commits, and only working commits. No WIP-code. NOT IN MY BACK... 
repository...

If you want to report a bug, use <https://secure.plaimi.net/bugs>.  If you 
want to discuss some the game, give us suggestions etc. -- use

Happy hacking!
